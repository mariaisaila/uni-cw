# COMP1004
<h3>HTML</h3>
- Add footer caption: This is Maria's Coursework for COMP1004.
<h3>CSS</h3>
- I decided to align a couple elements for aesthetic purposes.
- I made the main into a flexbox in order to make the results div fit better. Just using a precentage in relation to the main wasn't compatible with all the sizes of the window.
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
