# COMP1004
<h3>HTML</h3>
- Added footer caption: "This is Maria's Coursework for COMP1004".
<h3>CSS</h3>
- I decided to align the header elements for aesthetic purposes. </br>
- I made the main into a flexbox in order to make the results div fit better. Just using a precentage in relation to the main wasn't compatible with all the sizes of the window and some search results divs would even go out of it.
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
- I added loads of console logs and errors to make it easier to undestand what is going on in the JS code. Most of these help with identifying the errors and whether the data from Supabase was imported correctly.
- I added two new messages. The first is used in People Search and Vehicle Search. It reads: "Failed to fetch data, please check console for details." and it only appears if there was an error when selecting data from the database. The second is in the Add a Vehicle secotion and it reads: "Error adding vehicle, please check console for details.". Again this only appears if there was an insert error.
